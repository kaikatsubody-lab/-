## Response 1: Ethereal Cosmos (Mystic & Spiritual)
<probability>0.05</probability>

### Design Movement
**Ethereal / Celestial Modernism**
A blend of spiritual mysticism and modern web aesthetics, focusing on the concept of "Universe" and "Inner Light".

### Core Principles
1.  **Inner Radiance**: Every element should feel like it's emitting a soft light or reflecting starlight.
2.  **Flow & Fluidity**: Transitions should be smooth and liquid, mimicking the flow of energy.
3.  **Deep Immersion**: Use dark backgrounds to create a sense of depth and focus, like looking into the night sky.
4.  **Sacred Geometry**: Subtle use of geometric shapes to imply structure within the chaos of creation.

### Color Philosophy
-   **Background**: Deep Indigo (`#0F172A`) to Midnight Purple (`#2E1065`) gradients. Represents the vastness of the universe and the subconscious.
-   **Primary Text**: Starlight White (`#F8FAFC`) with a subtle outer glow.
-   **Accents**: Celestial Gold (`#FCD34D`) for primary actions and highlights, representing "Talent" and "Success".
-   **Secondary Accents**: Nebula Pink (`#EC4899`) and Aurora Green (`#10B981`) for different talent types.

### Layout Paradigm
-   **Central Focus**: Content is centered like a celestial body, with orbital elements floating around.
-   **Card-based**: Questions and results are presented in translucent, glassmorphism cards (`backdrop-filter: blur`).
-   **Asymmetric Balance**: While content is centered, background elements (stars, nebulas) are asymmetrically placed to create dynamic tension.

### Signature Elements
-   **Star Dust Particles**: Subtle background animation of floating particles.
-   **Glowing Borders**: Cards and buttons have soft, glowing borders instead of hard lines.
-   **Constellation Connectors**: Visual lines connecting steps or logic points.

### Interaction Philosophy
-   **Magical Feedback**: Clicking an option triggers a small burst of light or a ripple effect.
-   **Smooth Progression**: Moving between questions feels like traveling through space (zoom/fade effects).

### Animation
-   **Entrance**: Elements fade in with a slight upward float and scale up.
-   **Hover**: Buttons glow brighter and lift slightly.
-   **Transition**: "Warp speed" effect or soft dissolve when changing questions.

### Typography System
-   **Headings**: **Zen Old Mincho** (Google Fonts) - Elegant, traditional yet sharp, representing wisdom.
-   **Body**: **Zen Kaku Gothic New** (Google Fonts) - Clean, modern, and highly readable.

## Response 2: Organic Bloom (Nature & Growth)
<probability>0.03</probability>

### Design Movement
**Soft Organic Minimalism**
Focuses on "Growth", "Grounding", and "Natural Flow". Less about the cosmos, more about the earth and blooming talents.

### Core Principles
1.  **Natural Harmony**: Colors and shapes derived from nature (plants, earth, water).
2.  **Breath & Space**: Generous whitespace (or "air") to allow the user to breathe and reflect.
3.  **Gentle Guidance**: The UI feels like a supportive guide, not a machine.
4.  **Tactile Warmth**: Textures that feel like paper or fabric.

### Color Philosophy
-   **Background**: Warm Beige (`#F5F5F0`) or Soft Sage (`#F0FDF4`).
-   **Primary Text**: Dark Earth Brown (`#451a03`) or Charcoal (`#374151`).
-   **Accents**: Terracotta (`#D97706`) and Leaf Green (`#15803D`).
-   **Emotion**: Grounded, safe, nurturing.

### Layout Paradigm
-   **Split Screen**: Image on one side (nature photography), content on the other.
-   **Organic Shapes**: Rounded corners, blob shapes for backgrounds, avoiding sharp edges.

### Signature Elements
-   **Watercolor Textures**: Subtle background textures.
-   **Botanical Illustrations**: Line art of plants and flowers.
-   **Soft Shadows**: Diffuse, large shadows to create a floating paper effect.

### Interaction Philosophy
-   **Organic Unfolding**: Content reveals itself like a flower blooming.
-   **Gentle Pulse**: Buttons have a slow, breathing pulse animation.

### Animation
-   **Slow & Smooth**: All movements are slow and eased (ease-in-out).
-   **Parallax**: Background elements move slightly with mouse movement.

### Typography System
-   **Headings**: **Shippori Mincho** - Organic, flowing serifs.
-   **Body**: **M PLUS Rounded 1c** - Rounded sans-serif, friendly and approachable.

Focuses on "Discovery", "Clarity", and "Future". Sharp, clean, and prismatic.

### Core Principles
1.  **Crystal Clear**: High contrast, sharp lines, glass effects.
2.  **Prismatic Light**: Use of gradients that look like light refracting through a prism.
3.  **Precision**: Grid-based layout, precise alignment.
4.  **Empowerment**: Bold typography and strong colors to make the user feel powerful.

### Color Philosophy

-   **Accents**: Iridescent Gradients (Cyan to Magenta to Yellow).
-   **Emotion**: Professional, clear, awakening.

-   **Geometric Shapes**: Triangles, diamonds, hexagons.
-   **Frosted Glass**: Heavy use of blur with white opacity.

### Interaction Philosophy
-   **Snappy**: Instant feedback, fast transitions.
-   **Focus**: Highlighting the active element while dimming others.

### Animation
-   **Slide & Reveal**: Elements slide in from sides with a mask reveal.
-   **Glitch/Prism**: Subtle color separation effects on hover.

## Selected Approach: Ethereal Cosmos (Mystic & Spiritual)

**Reasoning**: The content is about "Reality Creation", "Talent Discovery", and "Universe". The "Ethereal Cosmos" style perfectly matches this thematic depth. It allows for a sense of wonder and introspection, which is crucial for a diagnosis tool. The dark theme with glowing elements will make the "Talent Types" (which are often associated with light/stars) pop visually.

**Design Philosophy**:
"We are uncovering the hidden stars within you."

**Implementation Details**:
-   **Font**: Zen Old Mincho (Headings), Zen Kaku Gothic New (Body).
-   **Colors**: Deep Indigo Background, Gold Accents, White Text.
-   **UI**: Glassmorphism cards for questions and results.
-   **Visuals**: Background will be a generated image of a "Mystic Nebula" or "Starry Sky".
